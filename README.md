# circlesounds

Play different sounds with different keys. A-Z (Also ä,ö, and å if you have them) and 1-0 will create different coloured circles and sounds. 
If you press any other key than the ones that create a circle/sound then it will crash and only play sounds. I am working on getting around this.
